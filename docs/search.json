    "section": "",
    "text": "As you‚Äôve heard in the news and social media, startups are becoming increasingly popular in public interest. According to Forbes, a startup is defined as ‚Äúa businesses that wants to disrupt industries and change the world‚Äîand do it all at scale.‚Äù Oftentimes, it‚Äôs high-risk high-reward, especially the earlier you are in it. This crucial early stage shapes the outcome of the business, and to keep it alive with high-growth, many founders raise rounds to fund their company. This paper aims to analyze the impact of early-stage funding on the longer-term success (or failure) of startups. For this research question, we will define ‚Äúearly-stage funding‚Äù as a startup that‚Äôs raised an angel investment and/or a series A investment. For more information about startup rounds, you may find some useful information here. The ‚Äúsuccess‚Äù of a startup will be defined in two separate ways: if the startup was in the ‚ÄúTop 500‚Äù startups (according to the data) and if the startup was acquired. As defined, please note that both success metrics will have their own respective analyses and findings, and correlation between the success metrics will not be performed in the scope of this article.\n\n\nThe dataset used in this analysis, startup-data.csv, includes comprehensive information regarding various startups including their funding history and current status. This dataset has data about different funding rounds as well as geographical information, average number of funding participants, and the current status of each startup (e.g., acquired, closed). The dataset provides a snapshot of 923 startups betweeen 1984 and 2013.\n\n\n\nThe objective of this data analysis is to examine the relationship between early-stage funding and the long-term success of startups. A key hypothesis is that startups receiving early-stage funding have a higher likelihood of long-term success compared to those without. This analysis aims to validate / challenge this hypothesis through some data exploration and statistical testing of the dataset.\n\n\n\n\nIdentify and categorize startups based on their early-stage funding status (VC, angel investment, and Round A funding).\nAnalyze the correlation between early-stage funding and the long-term success or failure of these startups.\nPerform statistical tests to ascertain the strength and significance of these correlations.\nUse visualizations to illustrate key findings and trends in the data."

    "text": "Conclusion\nIn this analysis, we graphed the relation between the proportion of startups who raised early funding rounds with both our success metrics of being in the top 500 and being acquired. From those results, we saw that there was a positive relationship and that there may be some indication of it being significant. After performing a logistic regression on both success metrics, the results suggest that there is no overwhelmingly statistically significant effect of early-stage funding on startup success. The findings indicate that other factors likely play a more substantial role in determining long-term success or failure of startups."
